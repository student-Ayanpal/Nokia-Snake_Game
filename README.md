📚 What I Learned
Building this project helped me learn by doing, which made the concepts more practical and memorable. Here's what I brushed up on:

- ✅ JavaScript DOM Manipulation – how to select, update, and respond to elements dynamically

- 🔁 Game Loop Logic – using setInterval, timers, and state management

- ⌨️ Handling Keyboard and Touch Inputs – supporting both arrow keys and on-screen buttons

- 🐛 Creating Game Features – like score tracking, special bug bonus, difficulty levels, and game over feedback

- 🎨 CSS Animations & Effects – glowing bubbles, retro UI, gradient text, and smooth visuals

- 📱 Responsive Design – making sure it works both on desktop and mobile

- 💡 The power of learning by building real projects, not just watching tutorials
